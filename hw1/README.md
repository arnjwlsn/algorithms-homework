#Homework Assignment 1

####Binary and Ternary Search Algorithms

This program runs both algorithms (ternary then binary) for increasing array sizes starting at 5,000 to 400,000 with increments of 5,000. For each array size, the array is filled with random integer values spanning from 1-100,000. A random value is searched using one of the algorithms and this is done 100 times for a new random value each time. The average time is then computed and printed to a file `results.csv` that can be easily opened in an excel spreadsheet and graphed to show the increase in time over the no. of elements in an array for both ternary and binary search algorithms.
